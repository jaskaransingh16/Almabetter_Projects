    Have you ever been curious about the best time of year to book a hotel room, or how long you should stay to get the best daily rate? Or perhaps you want to predict whether a hotel is likely to receive an unusually high number of special requests? This dataset on hotel bookings can help you investigate these questions! It includes booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, with details such as booking dates, length of stay, number of adults, children, and babies, as well as available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifiable information has been removed. Dive into this dataset to discover the key factors that influence hotel bookings.
